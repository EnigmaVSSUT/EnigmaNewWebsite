# EnigmaNewWebsite   :sparkles:

**DEMO_HERE** : https://enigmavssut.github.io/EnigmaNewWebsite/.

## Change Log:
1. Positioned Enigma-logo-particles as a responsive background.
2. Fixed Issue1. Resolution: brought that background image in-front of those hover-blocking divs and decreased the opacity to make it look like a background
3. Fixed Issue2. Resolution: decreased the particle-slider height and positioned to center.

## Issues Log:
- Issue1: Particles are not responding to hover: being behind of other divs/containers.
- Issue2: Anchor Tags in class intro-options not responding to hover: being behind of the slider particles.
- Issue3: Particle-slider disappears when clicked on Hamburger button.**<BUG>** **<PENDING>**

## Work to be done (EASY FIXING) :hammer_and_wrench: 

- **PAGE_1** : 
  - Basic structure will remain as it is and just try to replace the mockup text with the things we do.
  - In mobile and Tablet versions of webpage, proper padding and margins are required in '''class= "intro--options'''.
  
- **PAGE_2** : 
  - Basic Structure looks good as it is and here we will add the previous projects as well as milestones of the club.

- **PAGE_3** : Not sure about this page / open to suggestions/ **Will try to remove the stock images and add photos of our club.**

- **PAGE_4** : 
  - Basic Structure will remain as it is and it will contain contact us details.
  - Although the map is not of VSSUT ...but the style looks cool. A cooler **photoshopped image** (of VSSUT, Burla Map) is most welcome.  
- **PAGE_5** : In this page we will try to add some original documentations, medium articles or open source projects built by our club.
