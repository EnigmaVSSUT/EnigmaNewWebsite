# EnigmaNewWebsite   :sparkles:

**DEMO_HERE** : https://enigmavssut.github.io/EnigmaNewWebsite/.

## Change Log:
1. Positioned Enigma-logo-particles as a responsive background.
2. Resolved Entry1. Resolution: brought that background image in-front of those hover-blocking divs and decreased the opacity to make it look like a background

## Known Issues:
- Entry1: Particles are not responding to hover: being behind of other divs/containers.
- Entry2: Anchor Tags in class intro-options not responding to hover: being behind of the slider particles.

## Work to be done :hammer_and_wrench:

- **PAGE_1** : Basic structure will remain as it is and
just try to replace the mockup text with the things we do.

- **PAGE_2** : Looks good as it is and here we will
add the previous projects as well as milestones of the club.

- **PAGE_3** : Not sure about this page / 
open to suggestions/ Will try to remove the stock images
and add photos of our club.

- **PAGE_4** : It will reamin as it is and it will contain
contact us details/ and the map style looks cool.

- **PAGE_5** : In this page we will try to add some original
documentations, medium articles or open source projects built 
by our club.
