## Work to be done :hammer_and_wrench:

- **PAGE_1** : Basic structure will remain as it is and
just try to replace the mockup text with the things we do.

- **PAGE_2** : Looks good as it is and here we will
add the previous projects as well as milestones of the club.

- **PAGE_3** : Not sure about this page / 
open to suggestions/ Will try to remove the stock images
and add photos of our club.

- **PAGE_4** : It will reamin as it is and it will contain
contact us details/ and the map style looks cool.

- **PAGE_5** : In this page we will try to add some original
documentations, medium articles or open source projects built 
by our club.
